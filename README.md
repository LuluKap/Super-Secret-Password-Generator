# Super-Secret-Password-Generator

This generator will help you create a secure password.
The user can select their parameters such as letter caps, numbers, and special characters.
Once they have selected their password preferences they will pick a length.
If at any point they leave an area blank, say no to all parameters, or input an incorrect character they will be kicked back to the start and have to reselect.

Once all steps are complete you have a password that nobody can guess!!
